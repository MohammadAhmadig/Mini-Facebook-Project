# Mini-Facebook-Project
Implementation of Mini Facebook in Java with SQL (MySQL database)

It acts like real facebook that it fetches mutual friends from friends of user friends and then sorts them by interests.

- Simple but smart 
- User friendly multiple page(GUI)

Every user can create a new page or add it to their interest. The first page of our Facebook has two-part. One is created for signing in or deleting and another for signing up. The second page that is made visible is the user page that can change the user's picture, search for other users, add a new friend or unfriend with friends; it can change status and add interests.
